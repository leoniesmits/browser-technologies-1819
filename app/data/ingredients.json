            "description": "The basic idea behind oil cleansing is dissolution theory - or, more simply “like dissolves like” - oil is able to dissolve and remove substances with a similar chemical structure. Lucky for us, this includes stuff like dirt, oil, and makeup. This is the first step of the double cleansing method, something that's crucial for good skincare according to Korean experts. The next step is cleansing with an water based cleansing to deeper clean the pores.",
            "effects": "Oil can be a powerful solvent, but is also incredibly gentle. It’s great at getting rid of all the dirt and product you want off of your face without over cleansing and stripping your skin.",
            "directions": "Apply a small amount to wet skin, gently massage over face and eye area, rinse thoroughly, and pat skin dry with a soft, clean towel. However, some cleansing oils work best applied to dry skin, and then you either rinse with water or splash with water and work the oil into a milky emulsion before rinsing. Consult the directions on the cleansing oil you’re considering, but feel free to experiment to see which method works best for you.",

Start by using the product twice a week, then slowly increase the frequency based on how your skin feels. If you experience irritation, cut down on how often you use it. You may end up using your BHA only once or twice a week, and that’s totally okay!
